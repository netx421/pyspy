# pyspy
pyspy is a simple python security utility for quickly diagnosing if you have open ssh or ftp connections you don't really wan't to have. Cause you ain't about no B!@#$%^t. Any way run: "pip install psutil" from the cmd line to get the required python module for the script to run, and finally run the script with python3 pyspy.py ## you can tweak the ports that are being searched for now 21 and 23 are default.
